# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a how to guide of creating a webpage. 
My motivation and reasoning behind making this study guide was to create something I and others can use for help if you get stuck.
This guide is an understanding of how to use foundation phrases such as, 
- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- Github
 As well as programming and testing out your code. 

I learned the foundation of coding and how everything works and having an understanding of what prompts do what such as,
- CD (changes the directory)
- MKDIR (creates a new directory)
- Touch (creates a file inside the directory)
- PWD (checks to see if you've navigated to the right directory)
- LS (shows a list of files)
- git checkout -b (creates a new branch)
- git checkout main (goes back to the main branch)
- git status (tells you which branch your in)

## Installation

The steps required to install my projects was to first install bash and create a directory. Once my directory was created and titled (Prework-study-guide) I was able to then link my git hub to the directory and create branches from bash to git hub. Once the link was connected all of my code had to run through VS Code linking that to github and bash.
